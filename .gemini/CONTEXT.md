# Repository Guidelines

## Project Summary

This is a repository to create a shitty application.
Shitty application should not be useful but fun.
Shitty application is a web brower based app.

## Basic rules

### MUST

- The UI of shitty app is a dot based UI
- The language of UI must be Japanese
- Fun
- Web brower based app (Should not have serverside)
- Must be unique

### BETTER TO DO

- Prefer to be a game

## IDEAS for project

- Something like a minigame of "Made in Wario" game.
- Start with serious mood but ends with funny mood.

## Concept of the shitty app

### Hope simulator

GAME CONCEPT: “Hope Simulator 24”

A browser game that pretends to be a simple idle/clicker adventure.
But underneath, it systematically destroys the player’s hope every time they start making progress.

Clean at the start.
Unhinged by the end.

CORE LOOP

Player clicks to gather a resource called Hope.

They use Hope to buy upgrades to generate more Hope.

The numbers go up.

The player thinks: “Okay, I get it.”

Then the game betrays them. Hard.

THE BETRAYALS (Structured Over 24 Days)
Day 1–3: “This seems legit”

Clean UI

Hope increases normally

Basic upgrades working

Feels like a real clicker

Player forms trust. Good.

Day 4–7: “Something’s off…”

Introduce subtle sabotage:

Hope fluctuates +/- randomly

Upgrade prices silently increase

UI flickers once

A tooltip says: “Don’t trust the numbers.”

Still playable. Still ambiguous.

Day 8–12: “Did the game just screw me?”

The game openly betrays them:

Buying an upgrade halves all Hope

Numbers start drifting (“100” becomes “1O0” with letter O)

Upgrades occasionally disappear

A whisper text appears:
“You weren’t supposed to succeed this fast.”

Player starts arguing with themselves. Perfect.

Day 13–17: “The Hope economy collapses”

Full chaos begins:

Hope goes negative

Upgrades unlock themselves then lock again

Cursor gets slightly delayed

UI rearranges mid-click

A warning appears:
“Stop trying. I don’t want to hurt you.”

Now they’re committed, and the game punishes their commitment.

Day 18–23: “The descent”

Everything deteriorates:

Hope fluctuates violently

Music becomes detuned

Upgrades gaslight you (“You bought this already.”)

Scroll speed shakes

Daily challenge demands impossible requirements

The game restarts itself randomly

User feels trapped in the loop.

Day 24: “The Gift”

The game collapses:

UI fragments

Numbers overflow into nonsense

Hope explodes from -999M to HOPE = INFINITE

Everything turns white

One final message:
“You finally stopped trying to win. That’s when you won.”

It’s absurd, anticlimactic, and beautifully shitty.

WHY THIS WORKS

Because it hits the psychological progression perfectly:

Trust →

Investment →

Uncertainty →

Betrayal →

Desperation →

Forced acceptance

It’s not “just shitty.”
It’s a precision-engineered collapse of expectations.
