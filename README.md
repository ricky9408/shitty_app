# shitty_app

Shitty Applications is a playground for intentionally "useless but fun" web toys.

Every app must follow the rules from `.codex/AGENTS.md`.

## Directory layout

- `apps/` — each shitty app lives in its own subdirectory with its own assets/readme.
  - `katakana-terminal/` — かたかな秘文ターミナル。
