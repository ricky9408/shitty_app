# Repository Guidelines

## Project Summary

This is a repository to create a shitty application.
Shitty application should not be useful but fun.
Shitty application is a web brower based app.

## Basic rules

### MUST

- The UI of shitty app should be retro
- The language of UI must be Japanese
- Fun
- Web brower based app (Should not have serverside)

### BETTER TO DO

- I prefer dot-based UI design, but not essential
- Prefer to be a game
- I prefer golang but choose proper langguage to meet MUST rules.

## IDEAS for project

- A retro style game
- Something like a minigame of "Made in Wario" game.
- Start with serious mood but ends with funny mood.
